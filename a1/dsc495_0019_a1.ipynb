    "In this assignment we will get familiar with notebooks and some basic Python, including the print functions and variable assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like you to attempt each level of the assignment. They get progressively harder. To get **full credit** on this assignment, you must complete **Level I** and **Level II**. **Level III** gives you a chance to work with some more advanced printing freatures in Python.\n",

    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "This webpage is called a Jupyter notebook. A notebook is a place to write programs and view their results, and also to write text. For this class, I encourage the use of Notebooks to prototype work. In the future (either later in this class or beyond) you will likely want to write programs designed to run on all by themselves or interactively for end-users. But we generally will skip over that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for working in Notebooks, there are two types of cells (each rectangle containing text or code is called a **cell**): \n",
    "\n",
    " - **code cells** that hold executable code.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **markdown cells** that hold a special kind of text that follows the markdown syntax. To get familiar with the markdown syntax, take a look at this [Markdown Gudie](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Markdown cells (like this one) can be edited by double-clicking on them. After you edit a text cell, click the \"run cell\" button at the top that looks like â–¶| or hold down `shift` + `return` to confirm any changes. \n",

    "Notice how this print statement uses a special string character: `\\n`. The leading slash `\\` is special - it's called an escape charater. The following character tells python what to do with that escape charater. In our case, the `n` indicates there should be a new line before the rest of the text is printed. There are a number of special charaters you can find in Python. If you ever need to print a backslash, you can use it's own special character sequence: `\\\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backslash can also be used to continue a long line of code. Most standards recommend no more than 80 characters, including spaces, on a single line of code (although I use 88 since most modern monitors are big enough). I only suggest using a continuation backslash if you cannot find a place in your code to split the line neatly. We'll see example of that later in class."
