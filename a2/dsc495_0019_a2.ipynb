If you see an asterisk (\\*) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart Kernel**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If that doesn't help, restart your server. This is very rarely needed, but it's good to know how to do just in case. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, click **File** again and choose **Hub Control Panel** and select **Stop My Server** to shut it down. Then, after a few moments select **Start My Server** to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on. You'll still have to run your code cells again."
